A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child. The topmost node in a binary tree is called the root, and nodes with no children are called leaves.

The structure of a binary tree is such that each node has a value and two pointers (references) to its left and right children. The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with values less than the node's value, and the right subtree contains only nodes with values greater than the node's value.
